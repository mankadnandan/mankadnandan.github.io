## Abstract

- Reliability is very important at massive scale at which Amazon operates. Even a slightest outage causes significant financial consequences and impacts customer
  trust.

- Amazon.com, the e-commerce site, runs on top of an infrastructure which consists of tens of thousands of servers and network components, spread across many data centers
  across the world.

- At this scale of operations, it is to be assumed that small and large components continuously fail.

- The way the <mark>persistent state</mark> is managed in face of these failures, drives the scalability and the reliability of the software systems.

- This paper presents Dynamo, a highly available Key-Value storage system, that some core services of Amazon uses to provide an "always-on" experience.

- To achieve high availability:
        - Dynamo sacrifices Consistency, under certain failure scenarios.
        - It makes extensive use of object versioning.
        - Application-assisted conflict resolution.
