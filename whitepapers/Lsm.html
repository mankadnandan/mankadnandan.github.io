Assimilation of LSM-based Storage Techniques: A Survey
==============

Link to the white paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07527

## Abstract

- LSM: Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)

- LSM Tree is a widely adopted for use in storage layer of modern NOSQL systems.

- This paper provides a survey of recent research efforts on LSM-Tree, to understand the state-of-the-art in the LSM-based storage techniques.

- This paper also surveys several representative LSM-based open soure NoSQL systems and discuss some future research direction.

## Introduction

- LSM Tree has been adopted in the storage in many modern NoSQL systems like
    - BigTable
    - Dynamo
    - Hbase
    - Cassandra
    - Level DB
    - Rocks DB
    - Asterix DB

- Different from traditional indexing structures which does an in-place updates, the LSM Tree first buffers all writes in memory and subsequently
    flushest them to disk and merges them using sequential I/O (as opposed to Random I/O which does random access of the disks).

- This buffer, flush and sequential merge brings number of advantages like:
    - Superior write performance - Random access to disks (especially magnetic discs with head, as the head needs to be moved randomly which increases latency)

    - High Space Utilization - Here the deleted / older values of updated records are generally purged during the merge which helps prevent the disk fragmentation and helps in space utilization.

    - Tunability -

    - Simplification of concurrency and recovery - Since the updates are not in-place, we don't need locks on records on disc. Concurrency needs to be managed only for in-memory structures.

- As reported by FB in [Optimizing Space Amplification in RocksDB](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p82-dong-cidr17.pdf), Rocks DB, an LSM-Based key value store, alone has been used for following types of workloads:
    - Real-time data processing
    - Graph Processing
    - Stream Processing
    - OLTP Workloads

- This paper attempts to provide a survey of recent efforts to improve the LSM-Tree, starting from a KV store setting with a single LSM Tree, to a more general database settings with secondary index.

- This paper also surveys five representative LSM based open-source NoSQL systems:
    - Level DB
    - Rocks DB
    - HBase
    - Cassandra
    - Astrerix DB

## LSM-Tree Basics

- This section mainly goes over three aspects:
    - History of work on LSM-Trees
    - Basic strucure of LSM-Tree as used in today's storage systems.
    - Cost analysis of writes, reads and space utilization of LSM-trees.
