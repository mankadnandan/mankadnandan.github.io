    Assimilation of LSM-based Storage Techniques: A Survey
    ==============

    Link to the white paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07527

    ## Abstract

    - LSM: Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)

    - LSM Tree is a widely adopted for use in storage layer of modern NOSQL systems.

    - This paper provides a survey of recent research efforts on LSM-Tree, to understand the state-of-the-art in the LSM-based storage techniques.

    - This paper also surveys several representative LSM-based open soure NoSQL systems and discuss some future research direction.

    ## Introduction

    - LSM Tree has been adopted in the storage in many modern NoSQL systems like
        - BigTable
        - Dynamo
        - Hbase
        - Cassandra
        - Level DB
        - Rocks DB
        - Asterix DB

    - Different from traditional indexing structures which does an in-place updates, the LSM Tree first buffers all writes in memory and subsequently
        flushest them to disk and merges them using sequential I/O (as opposed to Random I/O which does random access of the disks).

    - This buffer, flush and sequential merge brings number of advantages like:
        - Superior write performance - Random access to disks (especially magnetic discs with head, as the head needs to be moved randomly which increases latency)

        - High Space Utilization - Here the deleted / older values of updated records are generally purged during the merge which helps prevent the disk fragmentation and helps in space utilization.

        - Tunability -

        - Simplification of concurrency and recovery - Since the updates are not in-place, we don't need locks on records on disc. Concurrency needs to be managed only for in-memory structures.

    - As reported by FB in [Optimizing Space Amplification in RocksDB](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p82-dong-cidr17.pdf), Rocks DB, an LSM-Based key value store, alone has been used for following types of workloads:
        - Real-time data processing
        - Graph Processing
        - Stream Processing
        - OLTP Workloads

    - This paper attempts to provide a survey of recent efforts to improve the LSM-Tree, starting from a KV store setting with a single LSM Tree, to a more general database settings with secondary index.

    - This paper also surveys five representative LSM based open-source NoSQL systems:
        - Level DB
        - Rocks DB
        - HBase
        - Cassandra
        - Astrerix DB

    ## LSM-Tree Basics

    - This section mainly goes over three aspects:

        - History of work on LSM-Trees

        - Basic structure of LSM-Tree as used in today's storage systems.

        - Cost analysis of writes, reads and space utilization of LSM-trees.

    ### History of LSM-Trees

    - Index structure can choose one of two strategies to handle update:

        - In-place Updates

            - Here, like B+ tree, the structure directly overwrites the old records to store new updates.

                - These structures are often read optimized, as only the most recent version of each record is stored.

                - However, this design sacrifices write performance as the in-place updates incurs random I/Os first to find the record and then update it.
                  [Typically, in a rotating disc, for a random IO the head needs to come on a place from where the data needs to be read. This is generally slow. It should be
                  noted that this might not be a big concern in the state-of-the-art SSD drives as there is no physical head movement in it.]

                - Also, this can reduce space utilization as the deletes and updates would cause fragmentation in memory.

        - Out-of-place Updates

            - Like LSM tree, these always stores updates in new location instead of overwriting old entries.

                - This design improves write performance since it can exploit sequential I/O to handle writes.

                - It can also simplify recovery process by not overwriting older data.

                - Though, a major problem with this is that the read performance is sacrificed as the value can be stored in any of the multiple locations.
                  [Typically, in a level based storage the algorithm might have to go multiple level up to find a particular record, as it might not be always stored in the
                  leaf page]

                - Also, these structures generally requires data re-organization process to improve storage and query efficiency.

    - The idea of sequential, out-of-place update is not new and has been applied in database systems since 1970. It has been used in "Differential Files" paper and also in
      "Postgres Project".

        - In the Postgres Project, the idea of <mark>"Log-Structured Database Storage"</mark> was pioneered.

            - In this, all writes were appended into a sequential log, enabling fast recovery (because, we don't over-write the record) and time-travel queries (again since
              we have the previous data available.)

            - It used a background process called "vacuum cleaner" to continuously garbage collect obsolete records from the log.
